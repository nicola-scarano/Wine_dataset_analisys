# Wine Dataset analisys with regression techniques

Abstract—In this report we introduce a possible approach to
the wine dataset consisting into a heavy preprocessing on the
categorical data. A deep analysis on geographical information
and on ’winery’ was carried out to allow us to reduce the
cardinality of these feature by continuing to retain important
information. Also a word embedding approach has been used on
’designation’.
